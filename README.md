# Educational Portfolio

This repository documents my progress, research, practical exercises, and audit-style reports as I develop professional-level skills in blockchain security and smart contract analysis.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate technical auditing capabilities, show hands-on practice, and track my journey toward becoming a highly competent Web3 security professional.
